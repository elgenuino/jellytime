# **F.A.Q.** #

## **Where can I download this awesome ROM?** ##
[Download Page](http://code.google.com/p/jellytime/downloads/list)

## **What's so awesome about this ROM?** ##
[Changelog](http://code.google.com/p/jellytime/wiki/Changelog)

## **Is a full wipe needed?** ##
No, it is not required, but it is strongly recommended.  If you choose to do a "dirty" flash, please do **NOT** post bug reports or issues you are having, as something from an earlier release might be causing the issue.

## **I flashed this awesome ROM but I don't have (insert Google app here) why?** ##
Gapps were removed from the ROM back on Alpha 7.  You simply have to download the gapps from [HERE](http://goo.im/gapps)(10.0.x is for JT 4.1.x and 10.1.x is for JT 4.2.1 ROMS) and flash via recovery.

## **Is Project Butter working on this ROM?** ##
vsync was implemented in Beta 9 and triple buffering in Beta 10. So, yes, Project Butter in included.

## **I'm having an issue and want to report it but I don't know how.** ##
First, check the [Issue Tracker](http://code.google.com/p/jellytime/wiki/SubmitBug?tm=3) to see if someone else has reported the same issue.  If no one has reported the issue then start a new issue and follow the provided template to describe your issue.  Don't forget to attach your logcat.

## **I keep posting an issue to the Issue Tracker but its not getting resolved or looked at.** ##
First, did you click the continue button on the page before the Issue Tracker? Yes? Are you sure you read that page and filed your report as explained on that page? No? Then there's your answer. Read the page that tells you how to properly submit a bug report and submit your issue properly. It will be marked as Invalid until it is properly filed after a day or two if is not filed correctly it will be deleted.

## **I keep reading about this "logcat" what is it and how do I make on?** ##
"The Android logging system provides a mechanism for collecting and viewing system debug output. Logs from various applications and portions of the system are collected in a series of circular buffers, which then can be viewed and filtered."<sup>1</sup> To learn more about logcats and how to create them please read both of these threads, they are very informative;

<h2><b>Is Jellytime better/faster then (insert your favorite ROM here)?</b></h2>
Its all a matter of opinion. You'll get 10 different answers from 10 different people. The reason for this is different people use their phones for different things, so what may be an awesome experience for one might be terrible and full of bugs for another. The best way to choose is to just flash Jellytime and find out for yourself.<br>
<br>
<h2><b>How's battery life?</b></h2>
This is also a matter of opinion.  Like the previous question you'll get 10 different answers from 10 different users.  People use their phones for different things.  The only true answer is to find out for yourself.  If you are having battery issues however, there are a few things you can do.  First, find out which apps are causing the most drain.  Kill them and see if that helps.  Second you can re-calibrate your battery (check <a href='http://www.xda-developers.com/android/calibrate-your-battery-the-easy-way-with-battery-calibration-for-android/'>THIS</a> out).<br>
